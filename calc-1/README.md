# Simple Console Based Calculator
This is a simple console-based calculator. Don't use it unless necessary. External gave a bad remark for this.

## Steps to run the code:
- Make sure Node.js is installed. Follow the steps from [here](https://github.com/heart2001/turbo-waffle#install-nodejs) to install.
- You need to first compile the Typescript to Javascript. Run `npm i -g typescript && tsc index.ts` and enter `Y` if prompted.
- To run the javascript, use `node .`
